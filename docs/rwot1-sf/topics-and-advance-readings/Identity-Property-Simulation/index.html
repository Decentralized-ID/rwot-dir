<h2 id="main-themes">MAIN THEMES</h2>

<p>The Internet was initially architected without consideration for a
secure, viable identity infrastructure. Passwords were an afterthought
and there was little consideration given to privacy and how
individuals could assert control over their personal data. These
factors combined with the move towards “personal data clouds,” mobile
and sensor data, and the recognized importance of protecting and
sharing personal data is forcing a fundamental rethinking of the
global Internet architecture for secure and privacy preserving
communications and computations. The decentralization of trust and the
shift towards a device centric network (i.e., pushing intelligence
towards the edge enabled by Trusted Computing and remote attestation)
are paving the way for a massive new ecosystem of distributed
marketplaces occupied by autonomous agents and their real-world
counterparts.</p>

<p>While the meager URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) has served
us well.  We now need to account for affording a digital identifier
with attributes, that bridge into the realm of legal personhood and
regulatory compliance and blur the distinction between and API
resource and physical property. Yet, this is no small
undertaking. What we need is a comprehensive reboot that anchors trust
in such a way that the physics of information applies with the same
certainty as our measures of the physics of the real world.</p>

<p>Today we are faced with an unprecidented opportunity to reshape the
manner in which we engage with resources represented on the world wide
web.  At the center of this shift is how we account for trust.  In
order to unlock the potential of P2P and decentralized transactions
taking place between entities, a relational matrix must be
constructed.  That is, a web of trust to empower digital entities to
seamlessly and at low cost/low friction- transact with each other in a
regime that can secure the interests of all parties.  In other words,
the next great internet revolution will take place once we can
simultaneously interact with existing systems and their legally
binding constructions and a new fabric for Identity and digital assets
powered by algorithmic governance.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-and-goals">CHALLENGES and GOALS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How do we make self-sovereign identity compatible with decentralized
property ownership systems?  For example, does it actually help to
flip the typical notion of identity and empower an autonomous agent
with virtual citizenship?  Can we then think of the agent “owning”
the physical entity that it refers to?  That is, can my digital
identity hold the “title” to me as a person and otherwise be
afforded the rights of a property owner?  Can this agent help me
originate my attributes as digital assets and realize the potential
and value in my latent human capital?</li>
  <li>Can we extend identity to ALL things and completely solve the
attribution problem?  That is, going forward, let’s assume that
there will exist enough connected devices with sufficient sensing
capability to literally identify and track all relevant
agents/actors in the world. Thus at minimum, a unique a behavioral
based identity can be granted to every entity and in many cases, the
link between these attributes and the real world entity could be
known only by its owner. In other words, how do we ensure that the
owner of this information can remain anonymous and yet be fully
compliant with top down regulation?  If we fall short of such
aspirations in the short term, how do we manage the trade-offs of
incomplete anonymity (e.g., vulnerable individuals in unstable
jurisdictions) while ensuring that all lawful interests are
protected as long as undetectable bad actors remain?  Can we
construct self-executing trusted escrows that hold reindentifying
information for the purposes of satisfying AML and KYC regulations
without leaking this information, notifying all named parties of
queries and following the rule of law?</li>
  <li>How do we solve the remote attribution problem such that we can
trust that the information physics of sensors and effectors is
robust and reliable enough to enable global scale simulations? Can
we establish identity with the granularity necessary to quantify
risk at all scales and from all perspectives?  That is, not only is
real-time auditing and compliance a desireable result in some cases
but we may further benefit from qualifying future states and their
likelihoods. If better data allows us to detect bad things when they
happen and what caused them, why not discover them before they
happen and prevent them entirely?</li>
  <li>How do we make it nearly impossible for a digital identity to be
stolen yet make it very easy and extremely accurate to recover a
trusted identity.</li>
  <li>How do we ensure the benefits of globally deployed block chain
technologies yet provide seamless quality of service across
localized network interruptions or subject to valid subsets of the
network remaining viable during connection outtages?</li>
  <li>If Identity is the new money, how do we make sure that it remains
fluid and make sure that we can always unlock its value?  Should we
think of identity as something that constantly needs to be burnt?
That is, instead of trying to protect a small number of highly
valuable HD private keys, should we engineer the solution such that
the entire system constantly expects the “root of trust” to be
changing?  If so, what other systematic risks remain?</li>
