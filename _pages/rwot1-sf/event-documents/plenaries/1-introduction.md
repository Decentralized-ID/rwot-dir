## PLENARY #1: INTRODUCTION

PGP is 25 years old, and we've had the opportunity to see some new ideas like Blockchain.

But now the time has come to reboot the Web of Trust. We are working for the goods of the commons.

The goal is to create 3-5 DOCUMENTS WITH IMPACT: white papers or specifications.

The results are more important than the process.

Docs will be in Github, but Google Docs is OK for things in process.

GROUND RULES:
1. Our individual contributions are our own.
2. Anything we create together must be Open Source.
3. Please don't quote someone on social media without their OK.
