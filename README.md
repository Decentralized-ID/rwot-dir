## README.md - Draft

This project is designed to make more accessible the valuable work that has been done, in collaboration with RWoT.

This began simply as a way to make the literature more accessable, I'm discovering that there is a wealth of high quality images that bring these workshops to life, and give the reader a more ogranic experience of the written word, with some added context, and appreciation for the process.

This project stirred to life, months back, when @identitywoman connected me with @JuanSC and @ericw , we began brainstorming and exploring different ways to work with this body of information.

This is only a demonstration, an MVP, if you like... 

It's a lot of work to process all of this content... and there's a lot more that can be done to make the research around Decentralized Identity more acessible. @DIDecentral will provide educational materials, also, on how to begin participating with minimal barriar to entry.

## Regarding the Quality of Images

The photos and graphic recordings from these workshops are all very high quality, in their home repositories.

After manually editing a couple hundred imags from RWoT1, I decided to use ImageMagic to bulk-resize them, with a maximum height\width of 1300.  This makes them large enough for creating a web-page, while not so huge as to hog all of your bandwidth.

I will encourage you to check out their home repositories if you wish to see any of the images in higher definition.
