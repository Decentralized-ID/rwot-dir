# Rebooting the Web of Trust -Archive

https://decentralized-id.com/rwot-dir/

This project is designed to make more accessible the valuable work that has been done, in collaboration with RWoT.

This began simply as a way to make the literature more accessable, I'm discovering that there is a wealth of high quality images that bring these workshops to life, and give the reader a more ogranic experience of the written word, with some added context, and appreciation for the process.
